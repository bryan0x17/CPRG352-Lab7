# Lab 7
## Topic: JPA
Description: Starting from Lab 6, replace the data access layer written in JDBC with JPA. Thatâ€™s it. Nothing else. ðŸ˜‰
Tips:
- Use the JPADemo to help guide you in the replacement.
- Depending on how well the layers of Lab 6 were designed, you hopefully should only need to edit the method bodies in the data access classes and services classes. Nevertheless, be prepared to edit more than just the data access and services layers. You may need to edit the servlet and JSP.
